# _Screenshoter_

### _Description:_

A program for creating screenshots of the screen.

After launching, the program waits for pressing the keyboard shortcut 
`Ctrl + Printscreen`. Then you should select the part of the screen that you 
would like to capture. The resulting image will be saved to the clipboard, and 
the result will be shown.

If you have a <ins>Windows</ins> operating system, you can also compile it by 
running the bat executable file `exe_creator.bat`. This script will save the 
resulting executable (exe) file to the folder `D:\MyConsoleUtils`
